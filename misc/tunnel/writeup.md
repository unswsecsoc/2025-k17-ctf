Legend has it that there is a tunnel that sprawls underneath UNSW's campus. It once was open to the public, but it is now heavily fortified. Even less known is that all the tunnellers used to hang out at the secret chamber along a long straight part of the tunnel where it widens for the distance of a small room.

**Note**: Please answer with coordinates of the secret chamber rounded to 3 decimal places and wrap your answer with K17{}. For example, if you think that the chamber is located underneath the Eiffel Tower, please submit `K17{48.858,2.296}`.

### Walkthrough

There genuinely is a tunnel that runs under UNSW that you can find people talking about by searching for "UNSW tunnel". However, it is much harder to find the location of the secret chamber within the tunnel. If you find all the references to tunnels and UNSW on Australian education websites using `unsw tunnel site:.edu.au` you'll find a link to the "Mall Services Tunnel Emergency Shutdown Procedure" `https://www.unsw.edu.au/content/dam/pdfs/estate-management/contractors/design-documents/2025-05-EM-Mall-Services-Tunnel-Emergency-Shutdown-Procedure-Compressed-2.pdf`. This is a document intended for contractors, but includes a diagram of the tunnel on the first page. The tunnel widens in the straight section beneath Globe Lawn, and the exact coordinates can be found using Google Maps.
